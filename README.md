# CMakeList requirements

- All projects are developed by Clang.
- Set env var `CUDACXX` to use NVCC preset under WSL.
- Test coverage is generated by running corresponding custom target.
- Required binary: `libomp-dev` (ray trace openmp), `llvm`(test coverages), `vcpkg`
- Build target `doctest` before building test targets
